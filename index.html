        <p>
          I have done my B.Sc. in EEE from AIUB. Doing my M.Sc in Uni Kassel in
          Electrical Communication Engineering. Currently I am learning Web
          Developing just as a hobby. I believe I can cross my expectations in
          this area. I am really excited to learn more about Web development.

        <p>
          I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple
          website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

        <h2>Other than Studies</h2>
        <p>
          In my 2nd semester of my Bachelor degree, I had joined AIUB Community
          of Engineering Students (ACES) which is the only core engineering
          organization in my university. I think, it was one of the best
          decisions to join ACES. It’s because I had the opportunity to work
          with research team there and to learn using different software such as
          Python, Matlab and Microwind. However, I also worked in ACES as a
          “Planning and Development Executive”, “Alumni Coordinator” and
          “Treasurer” which helped me to discover my management and leadership
          skills.
